      7.1 Certain features of the Platform — including posting or highlighting listings and accessing
      enhanced tools — may only be available through paid subscription plans (&quot;Subscriptions&quot;).
      Details of current Subscriptions, including free and featured tiers, duration, and fees, are
      displayed on the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2 By purchasing a Subscription, you authorise us to charge the applicable fees via our
      payment processor (Stripe) using the payment method you select. All fees are quoted in United
      Arab Emirates Dirhams (AED) unless stated otherwise, and are exclusive of any applicable
      taxes, which may be added as required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.3 Subscriptions may be offered on a recurring basis (for example, monthly or custom). If you
      choose a recurring Subscription, it will automatically renew at the end of each billing period at
      the then-current price, unless you cancel before the renewal date in accordance with Section 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.4 You are responsible for ensuring that your payment information is correct and up to date. If
      a payment is declined or fails, we may suspend or terminate your access to the relevant
      Subscription features until payment is successfully processed.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.5 Commitment to Subscription Term: Once you purchase any paid plan or feature, you are
      committed to the full selected term. We do not guarantee that your listing will result in any
      minimum number of leads, enquiries, or sales. This commitment applies except where
      mandatory rights are granted to you under applicable UAE consumer protection laws (Federal
      Decree-Law No. 15/2020). Please refer to Section 8 for your cancellation rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.6 Where we collect payments from you via the Platform, by providing your payment details at
      checkout, you authorise us (acting through our chosen payment processor) to charge the
      relevant payment method for the amount displayed. We will not be responsible for any losses
      you suffer if your payment method has insufficient funds to cover the full value of a payment.
