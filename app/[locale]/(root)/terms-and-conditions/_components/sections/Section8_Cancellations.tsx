      8.1 You may cancel your Subscription at any time through your account settings or by following
      the cancellation process specified on the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.2 If you cancel a recurring Subscription, you will continue to have access to the relevant
      features until the end of the then-current billing period. Your Subscription will not renew
      thereafter, and no further charges will be applied, except for any outstanding fees already
      incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.3 Unless expressly stated otherwise in writing on the Platform or required by applicable law,
      all Subscription fees are non-refundable. This includes situations where you choose to terminate
      your account early or where your account is suspended or terminated due to your breach of
      these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.4 We reserve the right to modify our Subscription plans and fees at any time. Changes will
      not affect current billing periods already paid for, but will apply from the next renewal. We will
      provide reasonable notice of any material changes. Your continued use after the effective date
      of changes constitutes your acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.5 All refunds will be processed to the original payment method used for the transaction. Upon
      completion, we will provide you with proof of the refund transaction, at which point our refund
      obligation is fulfilled. Any delays or inability to access funds (for example, due to an inactive or
      expired card) shall be resolved directly by you with your bank or payment provider. Refunds are
      processed within a maximum of 7–14 business days.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.6 If your original payment method is no longer active, you must notify us before the refund is
      initiated and provide valid evidence of an alternative payment method. We reserve the right to
      refuse processing to any alternative method unless such evidence is satisfactory and complies
      with applicable laws and our internal policies.
